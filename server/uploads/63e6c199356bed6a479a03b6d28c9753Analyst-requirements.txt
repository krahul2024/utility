This syllabus provides a structured roadmap for studying and mastering EDA. Keep in mind that EDA is a hands-on practice, so it's essential to work with real datasets and apply the concepts and techniques learned in each module. Additionally, the depth of study may vary depending on your specific goals and projects.
